## F3NR1R scripts
Python and Arduino scripts used in F3NR1R, my fennec-inspired shoulder AI bot.

## Companion Core
KiCad PCB design files for my "Companion Core" board. It connects a Teensy or Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense to servos, NeoPixels, etc., and powers the peripherals.  
Until I get a chance to clean up the directory, it's a mess! Use the -spine versions.  
May contain some custom footprints that I need to chase down and bundle up.
