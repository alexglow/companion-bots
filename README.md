## F3NR1R scripts
Python and Arduino scripts used in F3NR1R, my fennec-inspired shoulder AI bot.

## Companion Core  
// project: https://www.hackster.io/glowascii/companion-core-robot-heart-c79f52  
// order: https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/OIsucXlD  
KiCad PCB design files for my "Companion Core" board. It connects a Teensy or Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense to servos, NeoPixels, etc., and powers the peripherals.  
Until I get a chance to clean up the directory, it's a mess! Use the -spine versions.  
May contain some custom footprints that I need to chase down and bundle up. 

## Purr Module  
// project: https://www.hackster.io/glowascii/purr-module-for-companion-bots-fe393d  
// order: https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/xRD2UXla  
KiCad PCB design files for v1 of the Purr Module. It allows you to connect one or two pairs of haptic vibration motors to a 5V source (e.g., USB power pack). Next version will have a transistor built in and a 3-pin connector for the Companion Core, just like a servo or WS2812 LEDs!
